# Branding Process


## Research
We started by creating a mood board and handpicking colors to capture Popshop's aesthetic and emotions we wanted to resonate.

**Concerns-Based Adoption Model**
<br> <br>
In order to narrow down the logo choices and find the one that best suits our goals, I decided on 5 factors to rate: Memorability, Authenticity, Originality, Enduricity, and Appeal+Flexibility. We didn't immediately go with the logo with the highest score, but rather had a conversation about the top 3 and why we scored each one the way we did. This process was very effective because it made me think about why each design is valuable beyond the basic appearance of it. Additionally, combining numerical and subjective analysis of all 4 team members made us more confident and united in our choice.  <br> <br>
Here is the breakdown of scoring for each category and an example of Logo 10's critique.

**Final Choice**
<br> <br>
After much deliberation, the team tweaked what we loved from a couple different logos and are proud of our final logo below. We believe is captures our essence of youthfulness and sophistication as a proud women-run tech company.
